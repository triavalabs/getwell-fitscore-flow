    {
      question: "How much time do I need to commit each week?",
      answer: "Most clients see great results with 3-4 workouts per week (30-45 minutes each) plus meal prep time. I design flexible programs that work with busy schedules - whether you have 20 minutes or 2 hours, we'll make it work for your lifestyle."
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need a gym membership or special equipment?",
      answer: "Not necessarily! I create custom workout plans based on what you have access to - whether that's a full gym, basic home equipment, or just bodyweight exercises. I'll work with your current setup and help you get the most out of what's available."
    },
    {
      question: "Can you accommodate dietary restrictions and preferences?",
      answer: "Absolutely! I work with all dietary preferences including vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, dairy-free, and various cultural food preferences. I believe nutrition should enhance your life, not restrict it, so we'll find an approach that you actually enjoy."
    },
    {
      question: "What makes your approach different from other fitness programs?",
      answer: "I focus on the whole person - not just workouts and meal plans. My approach combines evidence-based fitness and nutrition with women's hormone health, lifestyle factors, and mental wellness. Plus, I create an inclusive space that affirms all identities while respecting diverse family values."
    },
    {
      question: "How quickly will I see results?",
      answer: "Most clients notice improved energy and mood within the first 2 weeks, physical changes within 4-6 weeks, and significant transformations after 3 months. However, everyone's journey is unique, and I focus on sustainable progress rather than quick fixes."
    },
    {
      question: "What level of support can I expect?",
      answer: "Support level depends on your program choice. Elite coaching includes weekly 1:1 calls and unlimited messaging. Group coaching offers bi-weekly calls and community support. All programs include access to me via the coaching app for questions and guidance."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you work with beginners?",
      answer: "Yes! I love working with women who are just starting their fitness journey. I'll meet you exactly where you are and create a plan that feels achievable, not overwhelming. Many of my most successful clients started as complete beginners."
    },
    {
      question: "What if I have a medical condition or previous injuries?",
      answer: "I work with many clients who have medical conditions or injury histories. While I can't provide medical advice, I collaborate with your healthcare team and modify programs as needed. Safety is always the top priority, and I'm experienced in creating effective workouts within medical limitations."
    },
    {
      question: "Is this program family-friendly?",
      answer: "Definitely! I understand the importance of family values and create programs that work with family life. Many clients include their kids in activities, and I provide guidance on modeling healthy habits for children while maintaining your personal health goals."
    },
    {
      question: "What happens if I need to pause or change my program?",
      answer: "Life happens, and I get it! All programs offer flexibility for life changes, travel, illness, or shifting priorities. We can pause, modify, or adjust your program as needed. The goal is long-term success, not perfect adherence to a rigid plan."
